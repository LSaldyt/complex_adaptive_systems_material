# Clustering Coefficient

Since all of the triplets in a completely connected network are closed, the clustering coefficient is the sum of weights for each triplet.
In a completely connected network like the one I've created, the coefficient is 1.0

However, definining an arbitrary distance metric could cut off larger distances from being considered... 
It would be arbitrary, though, 

So I think the same effect could be achieved by simply looking at the sum of distances.
